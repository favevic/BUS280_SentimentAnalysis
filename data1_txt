Selena Gomez has a message for fans heading into week four of the “drama” between her and Hailey Bieber. 

On March 24, Gomez revealed on her Instagram Stories that Bieber had reached out to let her know that she had been receiving death threats online as a result of the antagonism between their respective fandoms. 

“Hailey Bieber reached out to me and and let me know that she has been receiving death threats and such hateful negativity,” Gomez wrote. 
“This isn't what I stand for. No one should have to experience hate or bullying. I've always advocated for kindness and really want this all to stop.” 
She concluded the message with a red heart emoji.

Selena Gomez Says Hailey Bieber Contacted Her About Receiving Death Threats Amid Drama.

A refresher on the “drama”: Late last month Gomez's fans latched onto a theory that Kylie Jenner and Hailey—wife of Gomez's ex Justin Bieber—were shading the 30-year-old on social media as part of some long-simmering feud between the two women (which they have both denied exists). 

A Complete Timeline of the Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber TikTok Drama
Selena Gomez posted a new TikTok video after quitting the app.

Fans then began to resurface old clips of Hailey Bieber, including one in which she made a gagging face at the mention of Taylor Swift, a good friend of Gomez’s. 
When Gomez defended Swift in the comments of the TikTok video, which referred to Bieber as a “mean girl” and a “bully,” the drama ballooned. 
Though Bieber's strategy thus far has been to lay low and keep her head above the fray, her social accounts have been flooded with negative comments fo nearly a month. 

For her part, Gomez quit TikTok briefly, saying she was “too old" for a back-and-forth centered on her ex and his wife. 
Whether or not her latest message will get through to her fans remains to be seen. 
I, for one, can't wait for this to all be over.
